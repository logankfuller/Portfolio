# Portfolio

Hi, welcome to the GitHub page for my personal portfolio.

I kept a more simple approach to designing my portfolio because I believe in simplicity when available.

I decided to use CSS Grid for positioning because it makes it a lot easier than normal CSS and it now available in most browsers (except for some small issues in IE 11... But come on... really?)

## Design

I decided to take a similar approach to that used by Google in their Material Design 2 design framework.
